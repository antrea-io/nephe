This module maps Antrea internal NetworkPolicy in antrea.io/antrea/pkg/apis/controlplane/v1beta2
to cloud security group.

Network CRD
Each Antrea internal NetworkPolicy contains
-- name and namespace that uniquely identifies an Antrea internal NetworkPolicy.
   name and namespace corresponds to user facing Antrea NetworkPolicy.
-- list of rules (presently all are while list rules), each rule contains
    -- direction
    -- service (port) of this rule.
    -- To/From:  IPBlock and  reference to AddressGroup.
-- list of references to appliedToGroup

AddressGroup is used for To/From field of Rule in a Network policy, each AddressGroup contains
-- auto-generated name (namespace-less) uniquely identifies a AddressGroup.
-- a list  GroupMemberPod
    -- reference to Pod
    -- Pod IP and ports
-- a list of GroupMember, each contains
     -- reference to Pod if applicable.
     -- reference to ExternalEntity if applicable.
     -- a list of Endpoint, each contains IP and ports.

AppliedToGroup is used to the To/From field of Rule in a Network policy, each appliedToGroup contains
-- auto-generated name(namespace-less) uniquely identifies a AppliedToGroup.
-- a list  GroupMemberPod
    -- reference to Pod
    -- Pod IP and ports
-- a list of GroupMember, each contains
     -- reference to Pod if applicable.
     -- reference to ExternalEntity if applicable.
     -- a list of Endpoint, each contains IP and ports.

A SecurityGroup
-- is whitelist.
-- is configured per VPC, and is uniquely identified by its name or ID.
-- contains zero or more NIC/(VM??). A NIC/(VM??) may be associated with zero or more securityGroups.
-- contains Ingress rules, each rule contains
   -- IPBlocks : a list of source IP blocks of permitted incoming traffic.
   -- Ports: a list of source ports of permitted incoming traffic.
   -- SecurityGroups: a list of securityGroups from which incoming traffic is permitted.
-- contains Egress rules, each rule contains
   -- IPBlocks : a list of destination IP blocks of permitted outgoing traffic.
   -- Ports: a list of dest ports of permitted outgoing traffic.
   -- SecurityGroups: a list of securityGroups to which ongoing traffic is permitted.

Antrea internal NetworkPolicy To SecurityGroup Mapping strategy
-- Each Antrea AddressGroup is mapped to zero or more cloud membership only SecurityGroup, and zero or more IP blocks.where
   -- each cloud membership only SecurityGroup corresponding to a VPC, and a list of cloud resources.
   -- each cloud membership only SecurityGroup cannot have ingress/egress rules associated with it.

-- Each Antrea AppliedGroup is mapped to zero or more cloud appliedToSecurityGroup, where
   -- each cloud appliedToSecurityGroup corresponding to a VPC, and a list of cloud resources.
   -- each cloud appliedToSecurityGroup can have ingress/egress rules associated with it.

-- An Antrea internal NetworkPolicy is realized via cloud membership only SecurityGroups and AppliedToSecurityGroups
   -- create cloud membership only SecurityGroups and IPBlocks for each Antrea AddressGroups in To/From fields.
   -- create cloud AppliedToSecurityGroups for each Antrea AppliedToGroup.
   -- for each created cloud appliedToSecurityGroup creates ingress and egress rules based on cloud membership only
      SecurityGroups and IPBlocks associated with this Antrea NetworkPolicy.

-- Cloud resource to Antrea (internal/user facing) NetworkPolicy Mapping
   -- it is desirable to show what Antrea NetworkPolicies are associated with a specific cloud resource, and Antrea
      NetworkPolicies realization status
   -- each cloud resource shall keep track of cloud AppliedToSecurityGroups it is associated with.
   -- the union of Antrea NetworkPolicies associated with these cloud AppliedToSecurityGroups is entirety of the
      NetworkPolicies intended to this network resource.
   -- an Antrea NetworkPolicy is considered to be successfully applied to a network resource, when
      -- its AppliedToSecurityGroups to which the network resource is a member of, are created/updated with no error, and
      -- its membership only SecurityGroups are created/updated with no error.

-- Calls into cloud securityGroup are asynchronous for better performance/scalability.
