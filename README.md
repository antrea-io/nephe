# Nephe

## Overview

Nephe supports security policy enforcement across different Public
Clouds. It translates and enforces Antrea `NetworkPolicies` on Public Cloud
Virtual Machines using Cloud Network Security Groups. Nephe deploys  a
`nephe-controller` Pod in a Kubernetes cluster. Antrea must be the CNI of the
Kubernetes cluster.

## Dependencies

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/): Nephe is developed and tested
  with Docker version 20.10.17.
* [Antrea](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/): Antrea provides Antrea
  NetworkPolicy (ANP) CRD, and Antrea Controller computes ANPs on cloud virtual
  machines for Nephe.
* [Cert-Manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager): Provides in cluster
  authentication for `nephe-controller` CR webhook servers.
